# run SSIS packages in Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Yes, you can run SSIS packages in Azure Data Factory (ADF). Azure Data Factory provides a feature called **Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime** that allows you to lift and shift your existing SSIS packages to the cloud. Here’s a high-level overview of how you can do this:

### Steps to Run SSIS Packages in Azure Data Factory

1. **Create an Azure Data Factory**:
   - Go to the Azure portal and create a new Data Factory instance.

2. **Set Up Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime**:
   - In your Data Factory, create an Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime. This runtime allows you to run SSIS packages in the cloud.
   - Configure the runtime with the necessary settings, such as the node size and the number of nodes.

3. **Deploy SSIS Packages to Azure**:
   - Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Factory to deploy your SSIS packages to the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime.
   - You can store your packages in Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or SQL Server on Azure VM.

4. **Create a Pipeline in Azure Data Factory**:
   - In ADF, create a new pipeline.
   - Add an **Execute SSIS Package** activity to the pipeline.
   - Configure the activity to point to the SSIS package you deployed.

5. **Configure the Execute SSIS Package Activity**:
   - Specify the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime you created.
   - Provide the package path and any necessary parameters.

6. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Trigger the pipeline manually or set up a schedule to run it automatically.
   - Monitor the execution through the ADF monitoring tools.

### Example Configuration

Here’s a brief example of how you might configure the Execute SSIS Package activity:

1. **Add Execute SSIS Package Activity**:
   - Drag the Execute SSIS Package activity into your pipeline.

2. **Set Package Location**:
   - Choose the package location (e.g., SSISDB in Azure SQL Database).

3. **Configure Connection**:
   - Set up the connection to your Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime.

4. **Specify Package Path**:
   - Provide the path to your SSIS package.

5. **Set Parameters**:
   - If your package requires parameters, configure them in the activity.

### Monitoring and Management

- **Monitor Execution**: Use the ADF monitoring tools to track the execution of your SSIS packages.
- **Manage Integration Runtime**: Scale the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime up or down based on your workload.

This setup allows you to leverage the power of Azure for running your SSIS packages, providing scalability and flexibility. If you need more detailed guidance on any of these steps, feel free to ask!
