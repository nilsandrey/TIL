<https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/homepage/exporting-data-from-a-mysql-database-using-selectinto-outfile/>

```sql
SELECT <em>statement_elements</em>
INTO OUTFILE '<em>file_name</em>'
[FIELDS
  [TERMINATED BY '<em>string</em>']
  [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY '<em>char</em>']
  [ESCAPED BY '<em>char</em>']]
[LINES
  [STARTING BY '<em>string</em>']
  [TERMINATED BY '<em>string</em>']];
```
