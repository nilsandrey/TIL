# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute to my TIL repository!

I welcome submissions that fix typos and correct wrong or misleading
content. All you need to do is fork the repo, make a single commit with a
concise, descriptive message, and then submit it as a pull request.

If you are interested in contributing your own TIL content, I encourage you
to head on over to
[til-collective](https://github.com/til-collective/til-collective) and make your
submission there. As for this repo, I'd like to maintain it as my own
personal learning journey.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
